**Project title**: The title of my project is "Appointment-scheduler"

**Description**: 
I decided to embark on this project because I thought it was needful for clients or patients to make appointments easily and efficiently with their peculiarities appropriately taken care of. Every client is unique.
Peculiarities in patient care is very essential and must be taken seriously. Also patients would usually have their preferences based on language, gender and the qualifications or specialty of the doctor. The patients pay for their services and therefore deserve the best.
As a female and having lived in Germany for some time and being a native English speaker, I have been able to put myself in the shoes of patients who find it hard to communicate their health status to their doctors because they do not speak the language well or they are not comfortable with the gender of the Doctor handling their case. For example, some pregnant patients may prefer to be seen by a female Obstetrics & Gynaecology doctor. In addition, someone who speaks English will prefer to be seen by an English speaking doctor for a better expression. With this program, the health needs of the patients will be catered to.
In the process of working on this project, I learnt about how to use GitHub, the importance of first having a flow chart or diagram to analyse my thoughts before writing them in code amongst others. Most importantly, I learnt never to give up.
My project stands out because it is meeting a need. It is giving the power of choice to the clients who pay a premium for their healthcare. It allows the patients get the best care.

**Running the project**: Using the repo link, the program can be easily run on your local machine

**How to use the project**: The first interface asks the user what they want to do and the user follows the prompt by selecting the number for the desired functionality as listed. The user is able to list actions, add client, book an appointment etc and carry out other related processes as desired.

**Acknowledgements**: I am grateful to my Teachers and Mentor at ReDI who have painstakingly made coming this far possible.
